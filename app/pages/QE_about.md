### Context


There can be multiple ways of asking a particular query on ChatBot. The more variation a ChatBot is trained on, better its capability will be to understand customerâ€™s query. <br>
Example

Primary query  
What is your password policy?  
Variations:  
+ I want to know about your password policy?  
+ Can you explain your password policy?  
+ I am confused about your password policy, please explain?  
+ Tell me about your password policy?  

### Problem Statement

Currently for each query, these variations are thought through and generated manually. With time, number of queries will increase and manually it will take a lot of time to generate such variations for each query. Using NLP pre-trained model, we need to automate this process of variation generation
